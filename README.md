## Introduction
The goal of this project is to provide a set of utilities that allow you to efficiently compare and match documents based on their semantic content. By converting text into numerical vectors (embeddings), we can measure the similarity between different pieces of textual data.

### Key Features
- **Embeddings**: Convert text into dense numeric representations.
- **Vectorization**: Transform raw text data into formats suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- **Matching Algorithms**: Implement various methods to compute similarities between document pairs.

## Installation
To install all necessary dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed before proceeding with installation steps.

## Usage
Once everything is properly configured, you can start experimenting with the provided scripts or create new ones tailored specifically towards your needs.

Hereâ€™s an example workflow:
1. Preprocess your dataset.
2. Generate embeddings for each document.
3. Compute pairwise distances/similarities.
4. Visualize results or use them as input features for downstream tasks like clustering/classification.

For more detailed instructions please refer to our documentation (`docs` directory).

## Contributing
